1) What is UX design?
  User Experience (UX) design is the process of creating digital products or services that are easy, enjoyable, and efficient to use. The goal of UX design is to make the user's experience with a product or service as seamless and satisfying as possible, by understanding their needs, behaviors, and preferences, and designing interfaces that meet those requirements. UX design involves a combination of research, analysis, prototyping, and testing to ensure that the end result is not only aesthetically pleasing but also user-friendly and functional.
