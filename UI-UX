1) What is UX design?
  User Experience (UX) design is the process of creating digital products or services that are easy, enjoyable, and efficient to use. The goal of UX design is to make the         user's experience with a product or service as seamless and satisfying as possible, by understanding their needs, behaviors, and preferences, and designing interfaces that       meet those requirements. UX design involves a combination of research, analysis, prototyping, and testing to ensure that the end result is not only aesthetically pleasing       but also user-friendly and functional.

3) What is the difference between UX and UI?
   UI (User Interface) refers to the visual and interactive elements of a product or website, such as buttons, menus, and icons, that users interact with to accomplish tasks or    access information. UI design focuses on creating attractive, functional and easy-to-use interfaces that meet user needs.

   UX (User Experience) refers to the overall experience a user has with a product or website, including how easy it is to use, how efficient it is, how it makes the user feel,    and whether it meets the user's needs. UX design focuses on creating a positive and intuitive experience for users throughout their entire journey, from initial discovery to    long-term use. It involves understanding user behavior and feedback to improve the design of the product or website.

6) How do you respond to negative feedback? 
   When I receive negative feedback, I try to remain calm and listen carefully to what is being said. I focus on understanding the specific concerns being expressed and ask        clarifying questions if needed. Then, I take the feedback as an opportunity to learn and improve, rather than becoming defensive or taking it personally. I also try to thank    the person providing the feedback for taking the time to share their thoughts with me.

8) How would you improve the UX of our product?
    To improve the user experience (UX) of your product, I would suggest simplifying the design and making it more intuitive. This could involve reducing clutter on the screen,     using clear and concise language, and making sure the most important features are easy to find and use. It's also important to consider the user's goals and needs when           using the product, and to test the design with real users to identify any areas of confusion or frustration. Finally, gathering and analyzing user feedback regularly can         help identify opportunities for further improvement.
